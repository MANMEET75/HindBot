## Chatbot Overview

This chatbot is built using Google Gemini 1.5 Pro and features an end-to-end implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. The chatbot is designed to handle unstructured data in PDF format, which is collected through web scraping using Beautiful Soup from the official company website.

## Technical Stack
- **Modular Directory Structure:** Organized codebase for easy maintenance and scalability
- **Nomic Embeddings:** Convert words to numerical representations for efficient processing
- **Qdrant Vector Database:** Store and manage embeddings for fast querying and retrieval
- **Docker:** Containerize the application for easy deployment and management
- **FastAPI:** Create a robust and interactive web interface with a RESTful API
- **Frontend:** Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to provide a seamless user experience

## CI/CD Pipelines
- **GitHub Actions:** Automated CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and deployment
- Automated testing and validation of code changes
- Automated deployment to AWS Cloud infrastructure

## Cloud Deployment
- **AWS Cloud:** Deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for scalability and reliability
- **EC2 Instance:** Running the chatbot application on a secure and scalable EC2 instance
-** ECR:** Using Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for container image management
